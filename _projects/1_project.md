        **TALCO** is a novel method for **T**iling genome sequence **AL**ignment using **CO**nvergence of traceback pointers, that, similar to prior tiling techniques, maintains a **constant memory** footprint during the acceleration step independent of alignment length; however, unlike previous techniques, TALCO also ensures **optimal alignments under banding constraints**. TALCO does this by leveraging the convergence of traceback paths beyond a tile to a single point on the boundary of that tile â€“ a strategy that seems to generalize well to a broad set of sequence alignment algorithms. To demonstrate generalizability, we apply TALCO to widely-used banded sequence alignment algorithms, X-Drop and WFA-Adapt.
