High-throughput and low-cost sequencing technologies have enabled scientists to sequence within the same species at an unprecedented scale, fueling the field of Pangenomics that deals with the collection of genomes within the same species. Although, there has been significant advancement in pangenomics, existing pangenomic formats have limitations. 

We have developed a pangenomic format called PanMAT (Pangenome Mutation-Annotated Tree) that is information-wise rich, reference-free, compact, and scalable.
